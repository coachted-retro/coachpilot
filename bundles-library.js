// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all pre-built workout programs / bundles in
// CoachStack -- used by client-app.html (client-facing) and
// trainer-dashboard.html / client-detail.html (trainer's program picker
// when assigning a client). Imported from the Ironclad/pt-tools project
// as a starting catalog (July 2026) -- the two are separate products now,
// so edits here don't sync back to pt-tools or vice versa.
//
// Exercise objects: {name, sets, reps, rest, note?}. The 11 equipment-based bundles
// ported over from the old coach-only list (kb_foundations through foam_roller_recovery)
// only have {name} -- sets/reps/rest were never defined for those and are left blank
// rather than invented. Rendering code should treat sets/reps/rest as optional.
